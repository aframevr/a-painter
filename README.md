## Usage

- Grab a [WebVR-enabled browser](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/). Currently only the experimental Chromium build on Windows supports the Vive controllers. (You will need to enable these flags for WebVR and Gamepad Extensions: `chrome://flags#enable-webvr` and `chrome://flags#enable-gamepad-extensions`.)
- Head to [https://aframe.io/a-painter/](https://aframe.io/a-painter/) and start painting. See the [blog post](https://blog.mozvr.com/a-painter/) for some instructions.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:aframevr/a-painter && cd a-painter
npm install
npm start
```

Then, load [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Brush API

### Brush Interface

To create a new brush, implement the following interface:

```javascript
BrushInterface.prototype = {
  init: function () {},
  addPoint: function (position, orientation, pointerPosition, pressure, timestamp) {},
  tick: function (timeOffset, delta) {}
};
```

* **init** (): Use this for initializing variables, materials, etc. for your brush.

* **addPoint** (*Mandatory*): It will be called every time the brush should add a new point to the stroke. You should return `true` if you've added something to the scene and `false` otherwise. To add some mesh to the scene, every brush has an injected `object3D` attribute that can be used to add children to the scene.
  * **position** (*vector3*): Controller position.
  * **orientation** (*quaternion*): Controller orientation.
  * **pointerPosition** (*vector3*): Position of the pointer where the brush should start painting.
  * **pressure** (*float[0..1]*): Trigger pressure.
  * **timestamp** (*int*): Elapsed milliseconds since the starting of A-Painter.

* **tick** (*Optional*): Is called on every frame.
  * **timeOffset** (*int*): Elapsed milliseconds since the starting of A-Painter.
  * **delta** (*int*): Delta time in milliseconds since the last frame.

*Development Tip*: set your brush as the default brush at the top of
`src/components/brush.js` (`brush: {default: 'yourbrush'}`) while developing so
you don't have to re-select it every time you reload.

### Common Data

Every brush will have some common data injected with the following default values:

```javascript
this.data = {
  points: [],
  size: brushSize,
  prevPoint: null,
  numPoints: 0,
  maxPoints: 1000,
  color: color.clone()
};
```

* **points** (*Array of vector3*): List of control points already painted in the current stroke with this brush. (It's updated on every call to `addPoint`.)
* **size** (*float*): Brush size. (It's defined when the stroke is created.)
* **prevPoint** (*vector3*): The previously added point (from the last `addPoint` call).
* **numPoints** (*int*): Length of `points` array.
* **color** (*color*): Base color to be used on the brush. (It's defined when the stroke is created.)

### Registering a New Brush

To register a new brush we should call `AFRAME.registerBrush`:
```javascript
AFRAME.registerBrush(brushName, brushDefinition, options);
```

Register brush needs three parameters:
* **brushName** (*string*): The unique brush name.
* **brushDefinition** (*object*): The custom implementation of the previously defined `brushDefinition`.
* **options** (*object* [Optional]):
  * **thumbnail** (*string*): Path to the thumbnail image file.
  * **spacing** (*float*): Minimum distance, in meters, from the previous point needed to call `addPoint`.
  * **maxPoints** (*integer*): If defined, `addPoint` won't be called after reaching that number of points.

## File Format

A-Painter uses the following custom binary file format to store the drawings and its strokes.

```
string magic ('apainter')
uint16 version (currently 1)
uint8 num_brushes_used
[num_brushed_used] x {
  string brush_name
}
uint32 num_strokes
[num_strokes] x {
  uint8 brush_index (Based on the previous definition order)
  float32x3 color (rgb)
  float32 size
  uint32 num_points
  [num_points] x {
    float32x3 position (vector3)
    float32x4 orientation (quaternion)
    float32 intensity
    uint32 timestamp
  }
}

string = uint8 (size) + size * uint8
```
